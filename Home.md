JLine is a Java library for handling console input. It is similar in functionality to [BSD editline](http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) and [GNU readline](http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/) but with additional features that bring it in par with [ZSH line editor](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html). People familiar with the readline/editline capabilities for modern shells (such as bash and tcsh) will find most of the command editing features of JLine to be familiar.

JLine 3.x is an evolution of [JLine 2.x](https://github.com/jline/jline2).
